Just look at the published script !   VAR_modeling_script.m contains the modeling of the whole order book as VEC/VAR process.  It uses the great VAR/VEC Joahnsen cointegration framework.  After calibrating your VAR model, you then assess the impact of an order  using shock scenario (sensitivity analysis) to the VAR process.  We deal with 3 scenarii : normal limit order, aggressive limit order & normal market order).  Play section by section the script (to open up figures which contain a lot of graphs).   It contains a power point to help you present this complex topic.   The second item is entirely based on the following paper :  http://www.courant.nyu.edu/~almgren/papers/optliq.pdf   It contains a mupad document : symbolic_demo.mn  I did struggle to get something nice with the symbolic toolbox.  I was not able to drive a continuous workflow and had to recode some equations myself.  I nevertheless managed to get a closed form solution for the simplified linear cost model.   It contains a MATLAB demonstrating script : working_script.m  For more sophisticated cost model, there is no more closed form  and we there highlighted MATLAB numerical optimization abilities (fmincon).   It contains an Optimization Apps you can install.  Just launch the optimization with the default parameters.  And then switch the slider between volatility risk and liquidation costs  to see the trading strategies evolve on the efficient frontier.   It contains a power point to help you present this complex topic.  |

How can we automatically extract knowledge or make sense of massive quantities of data? These are the fundamental questions of machine learning. Machine learning and data mining algorithms use techniques from statistics, optimization, and computer science to create automated systems which can sift through large volumes of data at high speed to make predictions or decisions without human intervention. Machine learning as a field is now incredibly pervasive, with applications from the web (search, advertisements, and suggestions) to national security, from analyzing biochemical interactions to traffic and emissions to astrophysics. Perhaps most famously, the $1M Netflix prize stirred up interest in learning algorithms in professionals, students, and hobbyists alike. This class will familiarize you with a broad cross-section of models and algorithms for machine learning, and prepare you for research or industry application of machine learning techniques. Background  We will assume basic familiarity with the concepts of probability and linear algebra. Some programming will be required; we will primarily use Matlab, but no prior experience with Matlab will be assumed. (Most or all code should be Octave compatible, so you may use Octave if you prefer.) Textbook and Reading  There is no required textbook for the class. However, useful books on the subject for supplementary reading include Murphy's "Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective", Duda, Hart & Stork, "Pattern Classification", and Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman, "The Elements of Statistical Learning". |
