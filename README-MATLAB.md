Standard segmentation priors such as a Potts model or total variation usually fail when dealing with thin and elongated structures. We overcome this difficulty by using a conditional random field model with more expressive potentials, taking advantage of recent results enabling inference of fully connected models almost in real-time. Parameters of the method are learned automatically using a structured output support vector machine, a supervised technique widely used for structured prediction in a number of machine learning applications. Our method, trained with state of the art features, is evaluated both quantitatively and qualitatively on four publicly available data sets: DRIVE, STARE, CHASEDB1 and HRF. Additionally, a quantitative comparison with respect to other strategies is included. The experimental results show that this approach outperforms other techniques when evaluated in terms of sensitivity, F1-score, G-mean and Matthews correlation coefficient. Additionally, it was observed that the fully connected model is able to better distinguish the desired structures than the local neighborhood based approach. Results suggest that this method is suitable for the task of segmenting elongated structures, a feature that can be exploited to contribute with other medical and biological applications. |

Just look at the published script !   VAR_modeling_script.m contains the modeling of the whole order book as VEC/VAR process.  It uses the great VAR/VEC Joahnsen cointegration framework.  After calibrating your VAR model, you then assess the impact of an order  using shock scenario (sensitivity analysis) to the VAR process.  We deal with 3 scenarii : normal limit order, aggressive limit order & normal market order).  Play section by section the script (to open up figures which contain a lot of graphs).   It contains a power point to help you present this complex topic.   The second item is entirely based on the following paper :  http://www.courant.nyu.edu/~almgren/papers/optliq.pdf   It contains a mupad document : symbolic_demo.mn  I did struggle to get something nice with the symbolic toolbox.  I was not able to drive a continuous workflow and had to recode some equations myself.  I nevertheless managed to get a closed form solution for the simplified linear cost model.   It contains a MATLAB demonstrating script : working_script.m  For more sophisticated cost model, there is no more closed form  and we there highlighted MATLAB numerical optimization abilities (fmincon).   It contains an Optimization Apps you can install.  Just launch the optimization with the default parameters.  And then switch the slider between volatility risk and liquidation costs  to see the trading strategies evolve on the efficient frontier.   It contains a power point to help you present this complex topic.  |
